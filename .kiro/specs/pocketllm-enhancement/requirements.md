# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the PocketLLM Flutter application to create a production-ready, open-source AI chat application. The app currently supports multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.) but needs comprehensive fixes, improvements, and new features to be launch-ready for GitHub and app stores.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Application Stability and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to be stable and handle errors gracefully, so that I can rely on it for my AI conversations without crashes or unexpected behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app encounters any error THEN it SHALL display user-friendly error messages instead of technical stack traces
2. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the app SHALL show appropriate offline indicators and queue messages for retry
3. WHEN API keys are invalid or expired THEN the app SHALL provide clear guidance on how to fix the issue
4. WHEN the app starts THEN it SHALL initialize all services properly and handle initialization failures gracefully
5. WHEN memory is low THEN the app SHALL manage resources efficiently and prevent out-of-memory crashes
6. WHEN the app is backgrounded and resumed THEN it SHALL maintain state and continue functioning properly

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Dark Mode Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent dark mode support across all screens and components, so that I can use the app comfortably in low-light conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN all screens SHALL use dark theme colors consistently
2. WHEN switching between light and dark modes THEN the change SHALL be applied immediately across all UI components
3. WHEN the app starts THEN it SHALL remember the user's theme preference and apply it
4. WHEN using dark mode THEN text contrast SHALL meet accessibility standards for readability
5. WHEN viewing chat messages THEN message bubbles SHALL have appropriate dark mode styling
6. WHEN accessing settings pages THEN all form elements SHALL support dark mode properly

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Model Management and Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless model selection and synchronization across all app sections, so that my chosen model is consistently used throughout the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a model in settings THEN it SHALL be immediately reflected in the app bar and chat interface
2. WHEN I change the model from the app bar dropdown THEN it SHALL update the active model for new conversations
3. WHEN I select "change response model" from a chat message THEN it SHALL update the global model selection
4. WHEN the selected model changes THEN all UI components SHALL show the updated model name consistently
5. WHEN no model is configured THEN the app SHALL guide users to set up their first model
6. WHEN a model is deleted THEN the app SHALL handle the case gracefully and prompt for a new default model

### Requirement 4: Multi-Provider API Key Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily manage API keys for different AI providers, so that I can use various AI models based on my preferences and subscriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add an API key THEN the app SHALL validate it and show success/failure feedback
2. WHEN I save API keys THEN they SHALL be stored securely using platform-specific secure storage
3. WHEN I configure a new provider THEN the app SHALL test the connection and show the results
4. WHEN API keys are invalid THEN the app SHALL provide clear error messages and guidance
5. WHEN I have multiple providers configured THEN I SHALL be able to switch between them easily
6. WHEN I update an API key THEN existing model configurations SHALL be updated automatically

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Chat History and Conversation Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want robust chat history management with the ability to organize and switch between multiple conversations, so that I can maintain context across different topics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new chat THEN it SHALL be added to the conversation list with an auto-generated title
2. WHEN I switch between conversations THEN the chat interface SHALL load the correct message history
3. WHEN I delete a conversation THEN it SHALL be removed permanently with confirmation
4. WHEN conversations are loaded THEN they SHALL be sorted by most recent activity
5. WHEN I search conversations THEN I SHALL be able to find chats by title or content
6. WHEN the app starts THEN it SHALL restore the last active conversation

### Requirement 6: Ollama Integration and Local Model Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless integration with Ollama for running local AI models, so that I can use AI privately without sending data to external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure Ollama THEN the app SHALL automatically detect available local models
2. WHEN Ollama is not running THEN the app SHALL provide clear instructions on how to start it
3. WHEN using Ollama models THEN responses SHALL be streamed in real-time
4. WHEN Ollama connection fails THEN the app SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance
5. WHEN new models are added to Ollama THEN the app SHALL refresh the available models list
6. WHEN using Ollama THEN the app SHALL work offline without internet connectivity

### Requirement 7: Cross-Platform Compatibility and Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work smoothly on different Android devices and screen sizes, so that I can use it regardless of my device specifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on different Android versions THEN the app SHALL function properly on Android 8.0+
2. WHEN using different screen sizes THEN the UI SHALL adapt responsively
3. WHEN running on low-end devices THEN the app SHALL maintain acceptable performance
4. WHEN handling large conversations THEN the app SHALL manage memory efficiently
5. WHEN switching orientations THEN the app SHALL maintain state and layout properly
6. WHEN using accessibility features THEN the app SHALL support screen readers and high contrast modes

### Requirement 8: Advanced Chat Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want advanced chat features like message editing, copying, and regeneration, so that I can have more control over my conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I long-press a message THEN I SHALL see options to copy, edit, or delete it
2. WHEN I copy a message THEN it SHALL be added to the system clipboard
3. WHEN I request to regenerate a response THEN the app SHALL call the AI model again with the same prompt
4. WHEN I edit a message THEN the conversation SHALL branch from that point
5. WHEN I share a conversation THEN it SHALL export in a readable format
6. WHEN I clear a conversation THEN it SHALL remove all messages with confirmation

### Requirement 9: Settings and Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive settings to customize the app behavior, so that I can tailor the experience to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access settings THEN I SHALL see organized categories for different configuration options
2. WHEN I change model parameters THEN they SHALL be applied to new conversations
3. WHEN I configure system prompts THEN they SHALL be used consistently across conversations
4. WHEN I export settings THEN I SHALL be able to backup and restore my configuration
5. WHEN I reset settings THEN the app SHALL return to default values with confirmation
6. WHEN settings are invalid THEN the app SHALL show validation errors and prevent saving

### Requirement 10: Search and Web Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the ability to enhance AI responses with web search results, so that I can get more current and comprehensive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enable web search THEN AI responses SHALL include relevant search results when appropriate
2. WHEN search results are included THEN they SHALL be clearly marked and sourced
3. WHEN I configure search providers THEN I SHALL be able to choose between different search engines
4. WHEN search fails THEN the AI SHALL still provide a response based on its training data
5. WHEN I disable search THEN conversations SHALL work normally without web integration
6. WHEN search results are displayed THEN I SHALL be able to click through to source websites
