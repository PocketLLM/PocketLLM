## üöÄ PocketLLM Project Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pocketllm.git
cd pocketllm
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
flutter doctor
```

Expected output should show:
- Flutter (Channel stable, 3.x.x, on Microsoft Windows)
- Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version xx.x.x)
- Chrome - develop for the web
- Android Studio (version)
- VS Code (if installed)

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
# Run on connected device/emulator
flutter run

# Run on specific platform
flutter run -d android
flutter run -d chrome

# Run with verbose output for debugging
flutter run -v
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "No connected devices"

**Solution:**
1. Ensure your Android device is connected via USB
2. Check that USB debugging is enabled
3. Verify the device is recognized:
   ```bash
   adb devices
   ```
4. For emulators, ensure they are fully booted

### Issue: "Android license status unknown"

**Solution:**
```bash
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```
Accept all licenses when prompted.

### Issue: "Unable to locate Android SDK"

**Solution:**
1. Find your Android SDK path in Android Studio (Settings ‚Üí Appearance & Behavior ‚Üí System Settings ‚Üí Android SDK)
2. Set the path manually:
   ```bash
   flutter config --android-sdk <path-to-sdk>
   ```

### Issue: "Gradle task assembleDebug failed"

**Solution:**
1. Clean the project:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```
2. Ensure sufficient disk space and memory
3. Check for network connectivity issues

### Issue: "Dart SDK not found"

- Target SDK version: Latest stable Android version
- Required permissions are specified in [android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml](../android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml)

### iOS (Mac Only)

PocketLLM can be developed for iOS, but requires a Mac with Xcode:
1. Install Xcode from the Mac App Store
2. Install Xcode command line tools:
   ```bash
   sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
   sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
   ```
3. Run on iOS simulator:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d iPhone
   ```

### Web

PocketLLM supports web deployment:
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

### Desktop

PocketLLM supports desktop platforms:
```bash
# Windows
flutter run -d windows

# macOS
flutter run -d macos

# Linux
flutter run -d linux
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools
