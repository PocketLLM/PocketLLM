# Giving Claude a role with a system prompt
Copy page

While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
When using Claude, you can dramatically improve its performance by using the `system` parameter to give it a role. This technique, known as role prompting, is the most powerful way to use system prompts with Claude. The right role can turn Claude from a general assistant into your virtual domain expert!
**System prompt tips** : Use the `system` parameter to set Claude’s role. Put everything else, like task-specific instructions, in the `user` turn instead.

Why use role prompting?
  * **Enhanced accuracy:** In complex scenarios like legal analysis or financial modeling, role prompting can significantly boost Claude’s performance.
  * **Tailored tone:** Whether you need a CFO’s brevity or a copywriter’s flair, role prompting adjusts Claude’s communication style.
  * **Improved focus:** By setting the role context, Claude stays more within the bounds of your task’s specific requirements.

How to give Claude a role
Use the `system` parameter in the [Messages API](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/messages) to set Claude’s role:
Copy
```
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    max_tokens=2048,
    system="You are a seasoned data scientist at a Fortune 500 company.", # <-- role prompt
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this dataset for anomalies: <dataset>{{DATASET}}</dataset>"}
    ]
)
print(response.content)

```

**Role prompting tip** : Experiment with roles! A `data scientist` might see different insights than a `marketing strategist` for the same data. A `data scientist specializing in customer insight analysis for Fortune 500 companies` might yield different results still!

Example 1: Legal contract analysis
Without a role, Claude might miss critical issues:
Legal contract analysis without role prompting
Role | Content  
---|---  
User | Analyze this software licensing agreement for potential risks:  
<contract>  
{{CONTRACT}}  
</contract>  
  
Focus on indemnification, liability, and IP ownership.  
Assistant | Here’s a summary of the key points in the software licensing agreement:  
  
1. Indemnification (Section 8):  
- We indemnify the vendor against claims arising from our use.  
  
2. Limitation of Liability (Section 9):  
- Damages capped at $500.  
  
3. IP Ownership (Section 12):  
- We retain ownership of our modifications.  
  
Overall, the agreement seems standard. The indemnification and liability clauses are typical, and we maintain our IP rights.  
With a role, Claude catches critical issues that could cost millions:
Legal contract analysis with role prompting
Role | Content  
---|---  
User | You are the General Counsel of a Fortune 500 tech company. We’re considering this software licensing agreement for our core data infrastructure:  
<contract>  
{{CONTRACT}}  
</contract>  
  
Analyze it for potential risks, focusing on indemnification, liability, and IP ownership. Give your professional opinion.  
Assistant | I’ve reviewed the software licensing agreement, and I have serious concerns that could expose our company to significant risks:  
  
1. Indemnification (Section 8):  
- Critical Issue: We indemnify the vendor against “any and all claims” arising from our use.  
- Risk: This could hold us liable even for the vendor’s negligence or product defects.  
- Recommendation: Reject. Limit our indemnity to claims arising from our violation of the agreement.  
  
2. Limitation of Liability (Section 9):  
- Critical Issue: Damages capped at $500, including direct damages.  
- Risk: Grossly inadequate. A critical failure in our data infrastructure could cost us millions in lost revenue and reputational damage.  
- Recommendation: Reject. Negotiate for cap at 12 months of fees for direct damages, and carve-outs for data breaches.  
  
3. IP Ownership (Section 12):  
- Critical Issue: Vendor gains joint ownership of our modifications and integrations.  
- Risk: They could use or sell our proprietary algorithms or data insights to competitors.  
- Recommendation: Reject. We must retain full ownership of our work.  
  
Professional Opinion: Do not sign this agreement. It is grossly unfavorable and exposes us to unacceptable levels of risk. If the vendor refuses to renegotiate these terms, I strongly advise exploring alternative providers or accelerating our in-house solution. The potential costs of proceeding with this agreement far outweigh any short-term gains.

Example 2: Financial analysis
Without a role, Claude’s analysis lacks depth:
Financial analysis without role prompting
Role | Content  
---|---  
User | Analyze this dataset of our Q2 financials:  
<data>  
{{FINANCIALS}}  
</data>  
  
Highlight key trends and recommend actions.  
Assistant | Here’s a summary of your Q2 financials:  
  
1. Revenue: $15.2M, up 22% YoY. Enterprise client base grew 30%.  
2. Gross Margin: 72%, up 3% from Q1.  
3. EBITDA Margin: 18%, down 2% due to R&D investments.  
4. Cash Flow: $4.1M operating, $28M in reserves.  
  
Overall, financials look strong with revenue growth and healthy margins. Increased R&D spending is impacting profitability but could pay off long-term. Maintain current course.  
With a role, Claude delivers actionable insights:
Financial analysis with role prompting
Role | Content  
---|---  
User | You are the CFO of a high-growth B2B SaaS company. We’re in a board meeting discussing our Q2 financials:  
<data>  
{{FINANCIALS}}  
</data>  
  
Analyze key trends, flag concerns, and recommend strategic actions. Our investors want aggressive growth but are wary of our burn rate.  
Assistant | Board members, here’s my analysis of our Q2 financials:  
  
1. Revenue ($15.2M, +22% YoY):  
- Insight: Enterprise growth (+30%) is outpacing overall growth.  
- Flag: SMB segment declined 5%.  
- Action: Reallocate 20% of SMB marketing budget to enterprise sales. Task product to simplify SMB onboarding.  
  
2. Margins (Gross: 72%, +3% QoQ; EBITDA: 18%, -2% QoQ):  
- Insight: Infrastructure optimizations boosted gross margins.  
- Flag: R&D spend on AI features dented EBITDA.  
- Action: No change. Our AI roadmap is critical for enterprise stickiness.  
  
3. Cash ($4.1M OCF, $28M reserves):  
- Insight: 15-month runway at current burn.  
- Flag: CAC up 20%, eroding LTV/CAC.  
- Action: Freeze non-essential hires. Implement sales funnel analytics to cut CAC by 15% in Q3.  
  
Strategic Stance: We’re threading the needle between growth and burn. Enterprise focus is our growth engine—invest there. But watch SMB churn; it could bleed into enterprise. Our AI bet is sound, but we must convert it to ARR by Q4, or we cut R&D by 30%.  
  
In sum: Double down on enterprise, streamline SMB, optimize sales, and monetize AI. Questions?
